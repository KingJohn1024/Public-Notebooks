    "Build a flow chart of a game <span style=\"background-color:orange\"><b>with user interaction that uses all the file input/output features we covered in this model and everything else from previous ones</b></span>; YOU MUST VALIDATE ALL USER INPUT AND ALWAYS GIVE FRIENDLY ERROR MESSAGES. By this point, you might want to have some validation functions that you can use and re-use throughout the course; it is also important to have a control loop (outer loop) so that the player can quit the game when he/she wants; write the code for the game and explain its functionality; the game has to be functional without any error in order to get full points; explain the behavior of your code by writing plenty of good comments. Your game idea has to be unique. From now on, you MUST ALWAYS explain your code: documentation is crucial in programming and I want everyone to practice it, no matter how simple your code is; You can expand the game idea you posted on the discussion board if it was unique."

    "  * If either player has a pair, they pull the pair from their hands and place them on the table.\n",
    "  * One player goes first. The player picks a card in their hand that they’re trying to match, and they say, “Do you have a Jack?”\n",
    "    * If the other player has a Jack, the asking player gets that card and places both Jacks on the table. The asking player goes again.\n",
    "    * If the other player doesn’t have a Jack, they say “Go Fish!” The asking player draws a card from the deck and puts it in their hand.\n",
    "      * If the drawn card is the card they asked for, they place the pair on the table and go again.\n",
    "      * If the drawn card matches any other card in their hand, they place the pair on the table but don’t go again.\n",
    "  * The game is over whenever one player runs out of cards.\n",
    "  * The player with the most pairs at the end of the game wins, regardless of who ran out of cards first."
